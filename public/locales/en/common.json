Their system lacked mobile capabilities, suffered from high licensing costs, and could not support real-time data synchronization across dispersed branches.",
      "challenge": "One of the core challenges was the system’s inability to support hybrid offline/online operations, which made it extremely difficult for field agents to operate in rural areas with limited or intermittent connectivity. Additionally, the high cost of maintaining the legacy banking infrastructure placed a financial strain on the institution, diverting resources from expansion and innovation. Finally, slow customer onboarding and delays in microloan disbursements hindered the institution’s goal of accelerating financial inclusion in underserved communities.",

Their model required agility, brand control, and the ability to handle high-traffic bursts during launches. Initially using a third-party marketplace, they found themselves limited by fees, rigid templates, and poor brand identity control. They needed a system that could scale during product launches while maintaining creative freedom and operational efficiency.",
      "challenge": "Their biggest issues were sudden traffic spikes during drop days, stock allocation across regions, and slow updates to product pages due to platform restrictions. Customer complaints emerged around oversold items and unclear shipping updates. The team also lacked integration between their website, logistics provider, and CRM, which hampered post-sale communication and loyalty development.",
      "solution": "They switched to a custom-built store using WooCommerce on a cloud-optimized stack to handle scale during launches. The team used Bitrix24 to manage real-time customer service, pre-sale ticketing, and segmented marketing.
